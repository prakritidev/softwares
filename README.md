# Development Software For terminal

The motivation is to switch to other window as less as possible. Everything can be done in terminal itself. Except for data analysis and othert stuff.

This repository contains all the terminal tools for developerment, I don't wanna use GUI anymore.

The idea is to download these binaries on an oprationg systema and that's it, you have a working developemt workspace. This would be helpful for those who does not have enouhh CPU or RAM to work with.

## Development Tools

1. Neovim : Terminal based editor.
2. tBrowser: Terminal based browser with xray support.
3. tmux: You know what that is.
4. FileSycn: A peer-to-peer software for sharing data on any device.
5. tChatGPT: A terminal chatgpt that woeks with API keys.
6. templater: Create project template for REST API and other systems (AUTH, etc)
